# games
These are a collection of games i have made while teaching myself python, don't mind the ugly code in many of them or the many many bugs in most of them

Snake and tic tac toe are the only ones that don't really have bugs

2D-Fork-Knife is by far the one i've spent the most time on and is the coolest of the bunch. I built it to be played on seperate computers on the same local network. For whatever reason when you have more than two people playing there are more problems with the game that i haven't taken time to fix.

shooter is the by far the buggiest but was a cool concept that i never took the time to finish.
